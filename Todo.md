I'm quite happy with the current version and am slowly thinking about PRing so that Yacht Dice can become a supported game.
In this message, I'm planning to keep track of what I will do before the PR, what I will keep doing before, during and after the PR, and what I will not be doing before PR. 
*Let me know if you agree with the list or miss anything. Especially regarding the apworld, so gameplay specific comments like new ideas or items. If you suggested something previously and it is not on the list: chrisOops please suggest again*

**Will do before PR:**
-Tidy up the apworld and write some docs.

**Will keep doing:**
-Update client library (dependent on others, not critically important) :books: 
-Add new skins, maybe new music etc. 
-Improve client on website visually (make it like the text client) :newspaper: 
-Make it say you have the max number of dice / rolls instead of showing leftover fragments :file_cabinet: 
-Improve website in general (colors, buttons, options etc) :spider_web: 

**Will not do before PR:**
-Different dice (D4, D8, D20, D100). I don't think I will do this, as it doesn't seem to be a basic option. It might also create a lot of bugs :lady_beetle: , which is what I'm afraid of. I might add it to offline play. :game_die: 
-Be able to play with different dice in one game. So for example one D4, two D6 and a D8. This is a logical nightmare and will probably never be added. Maaybe to offline play at some point if I get bombarded with good reasons this will be fun 
-Death link: I don't like death link and so I'm not motivated to add this. I also haven't seen a deathlink idea I get excited about
-Trap items: same as death link.
-Add 'boosters', for example that you can add 1 to a dice, one time per game or turn. While nice for strategy,
