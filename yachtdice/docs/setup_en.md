# Yacht Dice Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- A browser for the html file.
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the [Yacht Dice Player Settings Page](/games/YachtDice/player-settings)

### Generating a Yacht Dice game

When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your YAML file to whoever is hosting. Once that is done,
the host will provide you with either a link to download your data file, or with a zip file containing everyone's data
files. You do not have a file inside that zip though!

### Connect to the MultiServer

Open the website. There are two options:
-Downloading the Player.zip and extract it. Then open player.html in your browser. 
-Go to the [Yacht Dice website](https://yacht-dice-ap.netlify.app/). This also works on mobile. If the website is not available, use the first option.

The website will ask for the login information. After logging in, you are good to go. The website has a built-in client.

### Play the game

You're ready to roll! The homepage of the website has some useful beginner tips and handy shortcuts.
