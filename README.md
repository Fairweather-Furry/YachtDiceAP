## Required Software

- A browser (you are probably using one right now!).
- Archipelago from the Archipelago Releases Page.

## Playing the game
Open the Yacht Dice website. There are two options:
- Download the latest release from [Yacht Dice Releases](https://github.com/spinerak/YachtDiceAP/releases) and unzip the Website.zip. Then open player.html in your browser. 
- Cruise over to the [Yacht Dice website](https://yacht-dice-ap.netlify.app/). This also works on mobile. If the website is not available, use the first option.

The website has an offline play option to try out the game without having to generate a game first.
